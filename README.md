# ELM_Bring_up_Petalinux
This repo will include ELM bring up tests for GEM,I2C, and  Petalinux Based tests. \

***Note-*** This project is under development so repo and readme is incomplete 

## Getting Started:-
### Using HTTPS:-
``` git clone --recursive https://github.com/bkushal26/ELM_Bring_up_Petalinux.git```

### Using SSH-
``` git clone --recursive git@github.com:bkushal26/ELM_Bring_up_Petalinux.git```

## Git Repo Structure for GEM1:-

### myproj
Working Vivado project saved in this folder (Vivado 2020.1)


### petaProj
(switched to 2020.1 version, so will update the project accordingly, (just the boot image files)
Working Petalinux project saved in this folder. 
1. Includes HDF sourced from `myProj/<project_1.sdk` directory.
2. Configured macb Driver in kernel Configuration. Steps for checking macb driver configuration:- 
 -  ```petalinux-config -c kernel ```
 - Then go to to `Device Drivers--> Network device support--> Ethernet Driver Support-->` \
 		`[*] Cadence devices`\
		`<*> Cadence MACB/GEM support ` (this option is not selected by default, press 'y' to select, 'n' to deselect.)
 - use left/right arrow keys to `<Save>` option.
	
3. Configured `iperf3` application. 
- In your `<project_dir>/project-spec/meta-user/recipes-core/images/petalinux-image.bb` append add the following line:\
   ```IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " iperf3"```(be aware of the extra space)
- In ```petalinux-config -c rootfs``` -> user packages, enable iperf3
	
### tcl
This folder contains tcl file which needs to be sourced when starting from scratch

### shellScripts
This folder includes shell scripts to automate the tests.
1. ping_iperf_client.sh-To be sourced on Board by- ``` sh ping_iperf_clinet.sh ```
2. ping_iperf_slient.sh-To be sourced on Host PC by- ``` sh ping_iperf_server.sh ```
 
Two tests are conducted-
 - Ping
 - iperf

#### Note regarding iperf tests- 
 If after launching shell script on the server, if this error is printed-```iperf3: error - unable to connect to server: No route to host``` then chances are firewall is blocking the iperf data packets. In that case, Follow the following steps-
 1. Check if the port is open by- ``` sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports ```
 2. If you dont see 5201/udp or 5201/tcp, add them by- <br />
 ```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=5201/udp 
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=5201/tcp 
sudo firewall-cmd --reload 
 ```

## Create a new project from scratch:
1. check the current working directory has 'tcl' folder.
2. Launch Vivado (2019.1)
3. In Vivado Tcl Console run :```source tcl/psddr.tcl```

## List of useful commands-
1. To check the usb port status- ``` dmesg | grep ttyUSB```
2. To launch serial terminal- ```screen /dev/ttyUSB? 115200```
3. Petalinux Project related -
- Create PetaLinux Project:- ```  petalinux-create --type project --template <PLATFORM> --name <PROJECT_NAME> ```
- Initialize PetaLinux Project (for custom hardware only):- <br />
``` petalinux-config --get-hw-description=<path-to-directory-containing-hardware description-file> ```
-  Configure the Linux Kernel:- ```petalinux-config -c kernel ```
-  Configure the Root Filesystem:- ```petalinux-config -c rootfs ```
-  Build the System:- ```petalinux-build ```
- package (for petalinux2020):- <br /> ``` petalinux-package --boot --format BIN --fsbl images/linux/zynqmp_fsbl.elf --u-boot images/linux/u-boot.elf --pmufw images/linux/pmufw.elf --fpga images/linux/*.bit --force```
## I2C related-
### HDF
It is a harware despcription file which is exported from Vivado (2019.1) to create Petalinux Project.

### PetaProj
Working Petalinux project saved in this folder. 
1. Includes HDF sourced from `I2C/HDF/ps_block_wrapper.hdf` 
2. Configured Cadence Driver in kernel Configuration. Steps for checking Cadence driver configuration:- 
 -  ```petalinux-config -c kernel ```
 Then go to to <br /> 
 `Device Drivers--> I2C support--> I2C support(I2C[=y])I2C hardware Bus Support-->[*] Cadence I2C controller ` <br />
 (this option is not selected by default, press 'space bar' to select, 'n' to deselect.)
 use left/right arrow keys to `<Save>` option.
3.
- In ```petalinux-config -c rootfs``` -> 
- a. ```I2C tools (filesystem packages-> base-> i2c tools )```
- b. ```GCC run-time (filesystem packages-> misc-> GCC run-time) ```
- c. ```Packagegroup-petalinux-buildessential (filesystem packages -> misc -> `Packagegroup-petalinux-buildessential ) ```

4.
- In  ```petalinux-config``` ->
- a. ```replace Image config --> SD card with Image Packaging Configrations  --> Root filesystem type --> SD card ```
5. Editing Device tree 

   ```<YourPetalinuxProjectDirectory>/project-spec/meta-user/recipes-bsp/device-tree/files``` 
    - Add this device tree
```
	/include/ "system-conf.dtsi"
/ {

i2c0 {

status = "okay";
clock-frequency = <400000>;
bus-id = <0>;
clocks = <&zynqmp_clk 61>;
compatible = "cdns,i2c-r1p14", "cdns,i2c-r1p10";
interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
interrupts = <0 17 4>;
reg = <0x0 0xff020000 0x0 0x1000>;
xlnx,has-interrupt = <0x0>;

eeprom@50 {

compatible = "microchip,24aa02e48";
reg = <0x50>;
};

eeprom@51{
                compatible = "at24,24a256";
                reg = <0x51>;
        };
};
};

```
